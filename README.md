# Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS

This was a project following along with the first chapter of Ben Frain's book. It was a basic structure and I played around with the REM units and also incorporated various media queries in order to make this wikipedia looking page responsive at different viewports.

## Updates 11/11/22

A revision was encouraged to make the page more semantic by using some of the lesser used HTML elements such as <figure> and <figcaption>.
